# Digital Twin Application  Preview

Digital twin is a dynamic, virtual representation of a physical object, process, or system. It mirrors the real-world entity by continuously collecting data from sensors, IoT devices, and other sources. This data is then processed and analyzed to create a digital replica that accurately reflects the behavior, status, and condition of its physical counterpart. By leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics, digital twins can simulate various scenarios and predict future outcomes. This enables stakeholders to monitor performance, diagnose issues, optimize processes, and make data-driven decisions in real-time.
